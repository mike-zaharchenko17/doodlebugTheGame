# doodlebugTheGame

Doodlebug: The Game is an ascii-based meme game created for my Tandon Bridge cohort.

Take control of a Doodlebug and use the arrow keys and space bar to move across
the grid and eat ants.

Watch your starvation counter- if it drops below 0, it's game over.

Controls:

Up Arrow - Move Up
Down Arrow - Move Down
Left Arrow - Move Left
Right Arrow - Move Right
Space Bar - Wait

Note: this project uses the conio.h library, which is only compatible with Windows
systems. Theoretically, if a MacOS/Linux user wanted to play the game, it would be fairly 
easy to download the source code and make it compatible with ncurses, but I don't currently 
have the time to do so.
